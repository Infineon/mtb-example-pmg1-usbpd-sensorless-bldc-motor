3. A 28-V EPR supported USB PD adapter is recommended as the power source to be connected to the PMG1-S3 kit. However, a USB PD adapter with 20 V, 5 A PDO also will support the motor operation. 

4. A standard EPR mode supported USB Type-C cable is used to establish connection between the Power Delivery (PD) source and sink devices.

5. Wire the three-phase terminals (A, B, and C) of the BLDC motor to the corresponding three output lines A, B, and C of the half-bridge MOSFET inverter circuit as shown in figure 1.

**Figure 1. Wiring diagram for BLDC motor**

<img src = "images/bldc-motor-wiring.png" width = "600"/>

**Note:** The firmware requires the centre terminal B of the BLDC motor to be compulsorily connected to the output line B of the inverter circuit. However, the other two terminals, A and B can be interchangeably connected to the outputs lines A or C of the inverter, which will decide the direction of rotation of the motor.

## Software setup

[EZ-PD&trade; Protocol Analyzer Utility](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy4500) may be used to analyze and debug the USB PD communication on the Configuration Channel (CC).

## Design and implementation

### BLDC motor controller

#### Sensorless BLDC motor

Sensorless BLDC motor consists of a set of stator windings powered by three different phases and permanent magnetic poles arranged along the circumference of the rotor. The commutation is carried out electronically by switching the currents through two out of the three phases using a microcontroller, leaving the third phase floating. In order to determine the sequence of commutation, the current position of the rotor with respect to the stator windings is to be known. In sensorless control technique, the rotor position is determined using the back EMF (BEMF) generated when the rotor embedded with permanent magnets rotate in-between the phase windings.

#### Trapezoidal commutation technique

The 6-step trapezoidal commutation is one of the most commonly used technique used in sensorless BLDC motor control. The term refers to the shape of the back EMF signal generated on the phase windings during the rotation. To maximize the performance, the drive current should match the back EMF signal waveform. This is achieved by switching the currents through the three-phase windings dynamically in a particular sequence at a particular instant, based on the relative rotor position. The set of commutation patterns for a complete rotation of the rotor can be divided into six steps as shown in Figure 1 and Table 2, with each step occuring at every 60 electrical degree rotation of the rotor.

**Table 2. Commutation logic table**

 Rotor electrical angle (degree) | 0 | 60 | 120 | 180 | 240 | 300 
 ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
  AH         |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  
  BH         |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  
  CH         |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  
  AL         |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  
  BL         |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  1  |  1  
  CL         |  1  |  1  |  0  |  0  |  0  |  0

**Figure 3. Power circuit for motor driving**

<img src = "images/power-circuit.png" width = "700"/>
<br>

The functions of various peripherals used in the control firmware is given in Table 3.

**Table 3. PMG1-S3 peripherals used and their functions**

 PMG1-S3 peripheral | Functions 
 ------------------- | ------------------ 
 12-bit SAR ADC | To measure speed reference signal and DC bus voltage and winding current
 CTBm - OpAmp 1 | To monitor the back EMF zero-crossing event and for commutation
 TCPWM - PWM | To control the speed of the motor
 TCPWM - Counter | For motor start-up and speed measuring
 USBPD block | To sink USB PD power from a PD source to drive the motor
 SCB UART | To print motor run-time paramters on a serial monitor

#### Control and commutation algorithm

The control system can be divided into three stages based on the tasks done, as follows:
1. Pre-position: This is the initial phase of start-up when the rotor poles aligns with the stator magnetic fields. This is required to start open-loop commutation as the feedback from back EMF signal is absent at low speed.

2. Free-run: During this stage, the BLDC motor is commutated blindly in open-loop as the back EMF feedback is still absent. The motor accelerates up to a threshold where the back EMF signal amplitude becomes measurable.

**Figure 4. Firmware flowchart for open-loop start-up**

<img src = "images/startup-fw-flow.png" width = "400"/>
<br>

3. Closed-loop control: This is the final stage of the control. Once enough back EMF amplitude is achieved, the control loop is closed, and the motor operates in a closed loop with the feedback from the back EMF signal, as shown in Figure 6. The speed of the motor can be controlled throughout this stage by changing the value of the reference input signal to the ADC.

**Figure 5. Firmware flowchart for closed-loop control**

<img src = "images/closed-loop-commutation-fw-flow.png" width = "700"/>
<br>

#### Firmware design and peripheral configuration

A brief information regarding the firmware design for sensorless BLDC motor control is as follows:
- A TCPWM block configured as a timer is used for start-up timing of the motor. The start-up phase of the motor consists of initial rotor alignment with a fixed stator winding. After the alignment, the rotor is accelerated by commutating the three phases as per the commutation logic table given in Table 2. The acceleration is achieved by varying the timer period in steps, based on the motor's moment of inertia. During this phase, the motor operates in an open loop without any external feedback.

- Once sufficient signal amplitude is achieved for the back EMF signal in the unpowered winding phases, the firmware closes the control loop, by sensing the back EMF zero-crossing events through CTBm OpAmp comparator. The analog multiplexer feeds the comparator with back EMF signal from different phases, in a cyclic manner.

- Another counter is configured to capture the time elapsed in successive back EMF zero-crossing events and is used to calculate current the speed of the motor. The reference speed is an analog signal applied using a potentiometer and is sensed by one of the input channels of the 12-bit SAR ADC. The error is the actual speed incomparison with the reference speed is calculated by the firmware, which then updates the necessary control effort required to nullify the error in the form the the right value of PWM duty cycle and commutation delays, using a PID control algorithm.

- Two other channels of the ADC reads sample value of input DC bus voltage and the motor winding current to implement necessary features such as under-voltage protection (UVP), over-voltage protection (OVP), and over-current or over-load protection (OCP).

- The user inputs available for controlling the motor are on-off control switch, motor reset switch and reference speed input. A user LED provides the necessary user interfaces to indicate various types of errors that are detected during the run-time.

Table 4 lists out the configurations of the various peripherals used in this code example.

**Note:** The value of these parameters are dependent on the specifications of the motor as mentioned in table 6 and may vary from one motor to another.

**Table 4. Peripheral configuration**

 Peripheral | Parameter | Value 
 ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------- 
 12-bit SAR ADC | clock frequency | 1.548 MHz 
 OpAmp comparator | Interrupt | falling edge 
 PWM | frequency | 24 kHz
 Start-up timer | period | 1 ms to 400 ms 
 Speed counter | period | 68.265 ms 
 USB PD | PDO | (5 V,0.9 A), (20 V,3 A), (28 V,5 A) 
 SCB UART | baud-rate | 115200 bps 


#### Closed-loop control system

During the closed-loop running stage, the BLDC motor is operated in a Proportional, Integral and Differential (PID) control loop. The proportional control counters the deviation from the reference speed value linearly. While the integral control helps in holding the speed during loading and minimizing the steady state error, differential control helps in damping the oscillations in the control and also improves the dynamic response of the motor in cases where the reference speed is abruptly varied.

**Figure 6. Block diagram of closed-loop PID control system**

<img src = "images/control-system-block-diagram.png" width = "800"/>
<br>

#### Protection and error detection

The firmware implements the following features for motor winding as well as the drive circuit protection. PMG1 MCU regularly monitors the input power supply voltage, the winding current and the motor drive conditions and triggers an error case when any of these crosses a threshold as mentioned in Table 5.

**Table 5. Error detection**

 Error condition | Threshold | Action
 ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------
 Under-voltage | 18 V | User LED blinks in sets of two
 Over-voltage | 30 V | User LED blinks in sets of three
 Over-current | 3.5 A | User LED blinks in sets of four
 Lowest speed | 564 RPM | User LED blinks in sets of six
 Commutation error | - | User LED blinks continuously at 1 Hz

#### BLDC motor specification

This code example uses BLY172S-24-4000 BLDC motor. The firmware is tuned to suit the specifications of this motor which are mentioned in Table 6.

**Table 6. BLY172S-24-4000 motor specifications**

 Parameter | Rating
 ------------------------- | --------
 Number of rotor poles | 8 
 Number of stator slots| 6 
 Winding type | Star/wye
 Speed | 4000 RPM 
 Power | 53 W 
 Voltage | 24 V 
 Peak current | 3.5 A 
 Rotor type | In-runner 
 Feedback | Back EMF/hall-sensor 

Other BLDC motors that is supported by both hardware and firmware specifications may also be used instead. However, the performance obtained in other motors are not guaranteed incomparison with the above-mentioned tested motor.

**Note:** See the application note [AN237305](https://www.infineon.com/an237305) for more details on firmware configuration for any other motor.

### USBPD sink

See [EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU: USBPD sink](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-usbpd-sink) example for information related to USB PD sink design and configuration.

The application initiates an Extended Power Range (EPR) mode entry request after a SPR contract is established, if the source is EPR capable. If the EPR mode entry is successful, the EPR sink maintains a regular communication with the EPR source to allow EPR mode to continue.


#### Compile-time configurations

The EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU USBPD sink application functionality can be customized through a set of compile-time parameters that can be turned ON/OFF through the *config.h* header or *Makefile* file.

<br>

#### PDStack library selection

The USB Type-C connection manager, USB Power Delivery (USBPD) protocol layer, and USBPD device policy engine state machine implementations are provided in the form of pre-compiled libraries as part of the PDStack middleWare library.

Multiple variants of the PDStack library with different feature sets are provided; you can choose the appropriate version based on the features required by the target application.

   - *PMG1_PD3_SNK_LITE:* Library with support for USB Type-C sink operation and USBPD Revision 3.1 messaging.

   - *PMG1_PD2_SNK_LITE:* Library with support for USB Type-C sink operation and USBPD Revision 2.0 messaging. Using this library will reduce the flash (code) memory usage by the application.

   - *PMG1_PD3_SNK_EPR:* Library with support for USB Type-C sink EPR operation and USBPD Revision 3.1 messaging. This library is chosen by default.

The library of choice can be selected by editing the *Makefile* in the application folder and changing the value of the `COMPONENTS` variable. To disable the EPR feature, set `CY_PD_EPR_ENABLE` to 0 in `DEFINES` in the *Makefile* and replace the `PMG1_PD3_SNK_EPR` reference with `PMG1_PD3_SNK_LITE`. To use the PD Revision 2.0 library, replace the reference with `PMG1_PD2_SNK_LITE`.

<br>

The extended power range capabilities supported by the application in the sink role are specified using the *EPR Sink PDO* section. A maximum of six PDOs can be added using the configurator. The maximum supported voltage is 28 V and current is 5 A, which amounts for 140 W of power sink.

Once the parameters have been updated as desired, save the configuration and build the application.
